## FAQ

### Why should use MagiskHide in Magisk Delta?

- MagiskHide is not dead yet. MagiskHide is still effective to hide root from apps.

- MagiskHide does not require to inject into zygote, so it will nearly not be detectable, does not like other hiding injection modules. And hiding root is not necessary to inject into zygote.

- Since Magisk Delta 25203, MagiskHide has switched to rely on logcat, make it is more undetectable.

- On Android 11+, it is unnecessary to inject into zygote in order to handle isolated process or app zygote.

- MagiskHide is removed from official Magisk. Leave users no choice to hide root from apps.

- Zygisk is easily detected and cannot be hidden, DenyList is the out of reality feature which unload zygisk in selected apps but does not hide zygisk, in additional it also make some modules less compatible and stop working. In fact, everyone will want their modules to work on apps that they hide root from.

- Riru has RiruHide to hide itself from maps. There are no such feature exists on zygisk. And Riru does not working if zygisk is enabled.

### How to switch from current Magisk to Magisk Delta and vice versa?

> Some Mediatek devices prevent boot partition from being modified (or kernel doesn't allow to modify boot image) after booting. When directly installing, you might end up with "/dev/xxxx is read-only" error or the installation seems to be successful but actually fails. In this case, please try patching boot image with Magisk app and flash it from Custom Recovery or Fastboot instead. 

The fast way to migrate to Magisk Delta or switch back to official Magisk: Just flash magisk app like a module.

1. Rename the extension `magisk.apk` to `magisk.zip`
2. Open Magisk app, click "Modules" tab -> "Install from storage" and choose `magisk.zip`
3. Reboot your device


### How to install Magisk into emulator (such as NoxPlayer, LDPlayer, etc...)?

> Currently, only Magisk Delta support Magisk installation into system partition. Although emulator has ramdisk image, patching ramdisk is not used because ramdisk is stored in seperate partition with very SMALL disk size that is not enough to store Magisk binaries.

1. Enable Root access in emulator settings
2. Install and open Magisk Delta
3. Grant root access to Magisk Delta, click "Install" under Magisk field and use "Direct Install into system partition" option instead of "Direct Install" option. If you don't see this option, close and re-open Magisk Delta app.
4. Disable Root access in emulator settings

### Why not restore Magisk modules online repo?

The official Magisk modules repository is dead and no longer maintained. Due to that, add them back is meanless. However, [Fox2Code](https://github.com/Fox2Code) has developed [Magisk Modules Manager](https://github.com/Fox2Code/FoxMagiskModuleManager)  app which allows you to download Magisk modules online.
